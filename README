  Information
  ===========
  
This is a custom MediaWiki search engine used at cppreference.com. The engine is
very simple - it doesn't analyze the content of the wiki at all. Instead, it 
fetches the search keyword list from one or more special files in MediaWiki: 
namespace and only matches search queries to the entries in that list. This is
suitable for cases where the search keyword set is very limited, which is the
case when identifiers of a C/C++ library are searched for.
